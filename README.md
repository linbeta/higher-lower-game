Day 14 project - Higher-Lower game

This is a my version of solution in the Day14 project in [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://100daysofpython.dev/#). (by Dr. Angela Yu)
I added a highest score feature, so that users could keep track on their highest score during game play!
